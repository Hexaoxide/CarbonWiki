# Why Carbon?

Carbon has been designed in order to address common shortfalls of other chat plugins, as well as add a whole new suite of features that expand on what has previously been possible with even premium, closed-source chat plugins.

## Why should I switch to Carbon?

Carbon is designed in order to be fast, efficient, and flexible, and allows for greater freedom and control over what you can do with chat. In addition to its efficient core structure, it is also well documented and has active support on the [discord](https://discord.gg/S8s75Yf) and in the issue tracker, making it a great choice for established servers looking for a supported solution to their needs, as well as new servers that are looking for the perfect chat plugin to start with.


## Why another chat plugin?

Seeing several downfalls in popular chat plugins, as well as features which server owners really desired but with no support, Carbon aims to be the all-in-one chat plugin solution, with anything a server owner would need to make an effective chat system.

## This plugin looks huge, and I need something simple and lightweight!

Carbon has been designed in order to be incredibly lightweight, and yet still offer all the features server owners need. As a result, certian heavier features are offered as extensions to the main plugin, extensions which greatly increase what Carbon is capable of and can even allow you to remove large plugins that are dedicated to features that Carbon extensions already cover seamlessly.

## What features does it have?

In this wiki's sidebar is a list of the main features of this plugin. However the main perk of this plugin lies in its basic structure. The entire chat system is built on channels, who can see them, their format, and other characteristics of channels, all of which can be controlled. All created channels are open on the server, and individuals with permissions to see them will see them, while individuals without permission to see them will not. This not only allows for the simple staff/player channels configuration, but nearly infinite other combinations. Integrated Towny Alliance and Nation channels can be fully controlled and formatted through Carbon, and can be watched by staff. Additionally, the ability to speak in a channel is different from the ability to see what is said in it. This allows for 'muting' global chat, setting up announcements channels with their own formats, and allowing for just about anthing else you could imagine.

As channels are completely independent from one another, each channel can have its own configuration, setup, and permissions. This allows for massive customizability at the very root of the plugin.

Other features include:
- [Pinging users in chat or on whisper, including sound](Pings)
- [Full PlaceholderAPI compatibility](Placeholders)
- [Discord linking extension](Extensions)
- [Chat spy features](Chat-Spy)
- [Alliance, nation, and party chats](Advanced-Configuration)
- [Chat moderation filters and replacements](Filters)
- [Full translation ability](Locale)
- [Multiple storage options](Storage)
- [Full bungee network support](Advanced-Configuration#Bungee-Support), including cross-server chat, whispering, formatting, etc.
