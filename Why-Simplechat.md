# Why Simplechat?

Simplechat has been designed in order to address common shortfalls of other chat plugins, as well as add a whole new suite of features that expand on what has previously been possible with even premium, closed-source chat plugins.

## Why should I switch to Simplechat?

Simplechat is designed in order to be fast, efficient, and flexible, and allows for greater freedom and control over what you can do with chat. In addition to its efficient core structure, it is also well documented and has active support on the [discord](https://discord.gg/S8s75Yf) and in the issue tracker, making it a great choice for established servers looking for a supported solution to their needs, as well as new servers that are looking for the perfect chat plugin to start with.


## Why another chat plugin?

Seeing several downfalls in popular chat plugins, as well as features which server owners really desired but with no support, Simplechat aims to be the all-in-one chat plugin solution, with anything a server owner would need to make an effective chat system.

## This plugin looks huge, and I need something simple and lightweight!

Simplechat has been designed in order to be incredibly lightweight, and yet still offer all the features server owners need. As a result, certian heavier features are offered as extensions to the main plugin, extensions which greatly increase what Simplechat is capable of and can even allow you to remove large plugins that are dedicated to features that Simplechat extensions already cover seamlessly.
